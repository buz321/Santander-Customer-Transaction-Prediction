# Santander Customer Transaction Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer transactions for Santander Bank using advanced machine learning techniques. By analyzing patterns in anonymized customer data, the model classifies transactions into a target class, providing actionable insights for financial decision-making.

## Objective
The goal is to build an accurate predictive model using machine learning algorithms and evaluate its performance on anonymized transaction data. This project aims to enhance customer behavior understanding, improve risk management, and optimize transaction prediction workflows.

## Dataset
The dataset is sourced from the **Santander Customer Transaction Prediction** competition on Kaggle. It includes:
- **Features**: Over 200 anonymized numerical customer attributes.
- **Target variable**: A binary indicator of whether a transaction belongs to the target class.

The dataset is divided into:
- **Training set**: Includes both features and target variable.
- **Testing set**: Includes features only (for model evaluation).

## Approach

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyzed feature distributions and correlations.
   - Addressed class imbalance and ensured data quality.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Standardized and normalized feature values.
   - Identified important features using tree-based models.

3. **Model Development**:
   - Tested and compared various machine learning algorithms:
     - Logistic Regression
     - Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM)
     - Random Forest
     - Neural Networks
   - Applied hyperparameter tuning using grid search and cross-validation.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Metrics: **AUC-ROC**, **precision**, **recall**, **F1-score**.
   - Assessed false positives/negatives for improvement insights.

## Results
- Achieved an **AUC-ROC score of X.XX** on the validation set.
- Identified key features influencing transaction predictions.
- Demonstrated practical applications for customer segmentation and risk management.

## Technologies Used
- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, XGBoost, LightGBM
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook
- **Version Control**: Git
